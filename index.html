    <h1>Best Characteristics of a Lion!</h1>

    <ol>
            <li>Lions are the only big cats to live in groups, called prides. Prides are close family groups. They work together to defend territory and hunt.</li>
            <li>The females in the pride tend to do the majority of the hunting. They work as a group and use intelligent hunting tactics to catch prey which they would not be able to catch alone as they are faster than them.</li>
            <li>Lions enjoy relaxing and lazing around. They spend between 16 and 20 hours each day resting and sleeping. They have few sweat glands so they wisely tend to conserve their energy by resting during the day and become more active at night when it is cooler.</li>
